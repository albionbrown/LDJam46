# Aqua Qaos

A submission for LD Jam 46 by Josh and Lottie. The aim is to keep the five cities alive by supplying them with enough water. The cities begin by using the same amount of water as the flow of their rivers bring in. If a fire starts, you must increase the flow of water in that city’s river so that the water level is above the fire level in order for the fire to be extinguished. If the fire is not put out, the city will burn! Leave the water levels too high and the city will flood! Not enough water and the city will be left droughted!
